## Zahra Ghodsi

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at University of California San Diego, working with [Farinaz Koushanfar](https://farinaz.eng.ucsd.edu/). My research interests include Security, Privacy, Machine Learning, and everything in between.

Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from New York University advised by [Siddharth Garg](http://wp.nyu.edu/ensure_group/), and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

I was supported by an Ernst Weber Fellowship (2015-2017), and a J.P. Morgan AI Fellowship (2019).
