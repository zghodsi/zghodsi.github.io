## Zahra Ghodsi

I am an assistant professor in the ECE department at Purdue University. My research focuses on building secure frameworks for emerging intelligent devices and applications, and spans applied cryptography, machine learning, and systems.

* I am currently looking for students to join my group. If you are interested in building secure and intelligent systems, feel free to reach out!*
